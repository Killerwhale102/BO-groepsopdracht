        <h3>THE FEATURES</h3>
        <p>
            As soon as you enter the museum, you are engulfed by everything that makes game culture so beautiful and impressive. 
            Follow our timeline through the atmosphere rooms and discover the history of video games through the gamechangers, 
            highlights and important moments in technology, artwork and culture within the game industry.
            Play classics, meet icons and discover the forgotten treasures of video games.
            The museum has around 231 game consoles, home computers and arcade cabinets ready for play, and 327 unique play areas. 
            This makes us the museum with the largest arcade in all of Europe!
        </p>
        
        <h3>THE LAB</h3>
        <p>
            Future and education go hand in hand, which is why at the Lab you will find the future of games and learn how you can be part of that future. 
            Be surprised by the museum's educational projects in schools and workshops where the latest technology is explained and taught. 
            The Lab is a dynamic space. From admiring game art to traveling through new worlds. 
            In the Lab there is always something new to experience: 
            one time you can learn all about the history of gaming during a lecture and the next time we welcome you there during a tournament or meet-up.  
            Experience the future of gaming, or shape it yourself in the Lab!
        </p>

        <h3>THE BARCADE</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to our Barcade, where modern hospitality and retro arcade cabinets come together in a cozy environment. 
            Here you can refuel after hours of adventuring, challenges and saving the world. In addition to the famous halal hot dogs and sandwiches, 
            we now offer healthy sandwiches.
            The Barcade is also open to the public who do not want to visit the museum, 
            so bring your judo teacher, your neighbor or your grandmother for a nice cup of coffee!
        </p>

        <h3>THE COMMUNITY</h3>
        <p>
            The presentation and research of gaming culture in a broad sense is one of the main goals of the National Videogame Museum. 
            Therefore, the museum would like to be the home for the Dutch game community. Think of gamers, programmers, designers, techies and of course, 
            cosplayers! The museum wants to bridge the gap between hobbyists and professionals.
            In 2020, we organized the first edition of the National Game Culture Days. During and after this event, 
            it was particularly indicated that a national platform for different parts of game culture is missed in the Netherlands and whether the museum could play a role in this. 
            This request also came from the (game) cosplay community. The museum would like to be this platform! In that context, we plan to organize events (concerts, tournaments, workshops) and digital projects for the game community in cooperation with Dutch players. One of the first museum projects is the attached video introducing the diversity of the game cosplay community. 
            We continue to develop and are always looking for great ideas and close collaborations. Do you have an idea? Be sure to contact us!

                        my favourite games are mortal combat and street fighter so i realy enjoyed playing the old versions in the museum.
                        i also like that the museum has a lot of old games and versions of the games that i played as a child.

                        we could choice what we were going to do on our outing with our highschool so the teacher chose this museum and it was a realy good choice.
                        it was a good choice because everyone was interested in the museum because everyone plays games.
