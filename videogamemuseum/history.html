        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            A garage box in The Hague is where the adventure began in 2008, 
            with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles. The garage box soon became too small after which they moved to a shed in an industrial area. 
            Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be moved to an empty Ministry of Agriculture building in the middle of winter. 
            When this building also had to be vacated, the then collection of 10 arcade video games with some spare parts was stored in an old classic car showroom. 
            Since there was no room there to renovate or play the cabinets, suitable space was sought. That was found in 2011 at the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer. 
            There Hasan decided to rent the location with 4 friends and the adventure could grow into its own meeting place to practice their hobby and relax with a game.

        <h3>Extra Life!</h3>
        <p>
            In 2016, Hasan came into contact with Jan Kragt, city marketer of the municipality of Zoetermeer, 
            who, deeply impressed by the collection, suggested the idea of turning it into a museum and establishing a foundation for that purpose. 
            On the spot, Hasan and Jan came up with the name and the National Videogame Museum was born. 
            Together with a number of important players from the Dutch game community, the National Videogame Museum Foundation was then created. 
            The city council was enthusiastic about the idea and decided to support the museum financially. 
            This made it possible to rent a heated storage facility where the entire collection could be housed and partially exhibited. 
            In early 2017, in close cooperation with the municipality, a real museum location was found: the former V&D building in the city center of Zoetermeer.
