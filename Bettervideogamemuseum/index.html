            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
            It has survived not only five centuries, 
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
            remaining essentially unchanged. 
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                        We had family visiting from overseas and decided to visit here with our children and they enjoyed the day very much. 
                        I think the parents may have enjoyed it more than the children 
                        (if that's possible) as they had lots of old school games from the 1980's. 
                        Great!!!

                        I liked games such as Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Pinball. 
                        My sons played on a variety of games and loved the fact that there are no coins required. 
                        They could relax and have fun.

                        had such fun in here! 
                        They have a lot of old and interesting games and you can soend the whole day in there. 
                        Most games can be played with 2 people and some with 4
